# **App Name**: Codenames Duet AI

## Core Features:

- Word Grid Display: Display a 5x5 grid of word cards for the game.
- AI Clue Generator: Provide AI-generated clues based on the current board state, helping one player to guess words that are green on the other player's key card, considering both green agents and assassins on the key card. The AI tool should evaluate clues for validity to minimize rule violations.
- Card Marking and Status Tracking: Allow users to mark cards as correctly guessed (green), incorrect (bystander), or assassin (black), as well as tracking timer tokens.

- Accent: Teal (#26A69A) for interactive elements and highlighting, like the clue button.
- Clear and readable sans-serif fonts for the word cards and interface elements.
